## Data considerations

All data has a lifecycle associated with it

Data ownership and data sovereignty - cloud based servers and third party vendors or global

Risk - result of failure to provide for CIA

Confidentiality
 - how secure is the information and how secure does that info need to be?
 - Confidentiality failes if someone can obtain and view the data we are attempting to protect
 - If someone gains the file but it is encrypted, it is still confidential
 - Encryption
 
Integrity
- How correct is the info 
- Has it been modified in transit or in storage
- Hashing
- Checksums
- Failed if its modified

Availability
 - Data is available when and where it is needed
 - Uptime and accessible by end users
 - redundancy 
 - Disaster recovery plan
 - Fails if user is unable to use the data when needed 

Categorize potential risk 
	Low 	 - Limited 
	Moderate  -  More serious
	High - Severe and potentially catastrophic

Categorization is required by IS owned or used by USG FIPS

### Data Classification
Based on it's value to the org and sensitivity of the info if it were to be disclosed

Over classification leads to higher costs that are unnecessary

Two common classification schemes

Commercial business
 - Public  - No impact to company
 - Sensitive - Minimal impact 
 - Private - Info such as personnel record, salary etc
 - Confidential - Trade secrets, IP , source code etc

Military and Govt
- Unclassified - Released to public under FOIA
- CUI - Unclass but should be protected - medical records
- Confidential - trade secrets - seriously affect the govt
- Secret - deployment plans - seriously damage
- Top Secret - blueprints - gravely damage 

Protecting data takes resources 

Data should not be stored forever

Policies should be enacted for when data is retained or destroyed

### Data Types
Data type is a tag or label to identify data under subcategory under classification

PII

SPI

PHI
