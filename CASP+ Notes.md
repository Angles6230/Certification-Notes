## Data considerations

All data has a lifecycle associated with it

Data ownership and data sovereignty - cloud based servers and third party vendors or global

Risk - result of failure to provide for CIA

Confidentiality

 - how secure is the information and how secure does that info need to be?
 - Confidentiality failes if someone can obtain and view the data we are attempting to protect
 - If someone gains the file but it is encrypted, it is still confidential
 - Encryption
 
Integrity

- How correct is the info 
- Has it been modified in transit or in storage
- Hashing
- Checksums
- Failed if its modified

Availability
 - Data is available when and where it is needed
 - Uptime and accessible by end users
 - redundancy 
 - Disaster recovery plan
 - Fails if user is unable to use the data when needed
